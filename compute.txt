########## COMPUTE Resources ##########

### Instance
instance is:
    - contained in a project
    - a Region and zone


### App Engine
app engine is:
    - contained in a project
    - a Region and zone
    - BUT not any user management on resources, we just provide code to be run
    - resources based on instance class opted 

    => Standard
    => Flexible
        Standard + abilitity to configure containers
        For apps composed by services, each being containerized

==> good choice for a computing platform when you have little need to configure and control the underlying operating system or storage system

 
### Kubernetes Engine
GKE:
    - Standard = pay for node + management by user
    - Autopilot = pay for node + gcloud auto management


### Anthos
increasingly important service that is used to managed services and resources across clouds and on-premises environments


### Cloud run
used to deploy stateless containers
to run code in containers without managing infrastructure


### Cloud Functions
serverless computing platform designed to run single-purpose pieces of code in response to events in the Google Cloud environment


### Snapshot 
==> copy of data on a persistent disk
can be a copy of a bootable disk
incrementing mode


### Image
==> copy of a disk
used to create VMs
single complete backup
can be created from:
    images
    disks
    Snapshot
    cloud storage file
    virtual disk
