Folder
building blocks of multilayer organizational hierarchies
OPTIONAL and do not have to be used

Project
most important part of the hierarchy
It is in projects that we create resources, use Google Cloud services, manage permissions, and manage billing options
Any account has the 2 roles:
    resourcemanager.projects.create IAM
    Billing Account Creator role



### Roles

# Basic roles
Owner, Editor, and Viewer

# Predefined roles
best practice to use
predefined roles instead of basic roles when possible
specific to Google Cloud products and managed and updated by Google

# Custom roles
allow cloud administrators to create and administer their own roles
some permission, such as iam.ServiceAccounts.getAccessToken, are not available in custom roles


### Service Accounts
two types of service accounts: 
    user-managed service accounts 
    Googlemanaged service accounts
When we create a project that has the Compute Engine API enabled, a Compute Engine service
account is created automatically
